Action
Overwatch
Release date: May 24, 2016 ▪ Developer: Blizzard ▪ Our review (88%)
A great team shooter that emphasizes positioning, teamwork and tactics over agility and marksmanship, but still leaves room for players to grow in the latter department. There are still character tweaks to be made to ensure they’re continuously viable and fun and all create interesting dynamics, but it’s the sort of game you could tweak forever. Overwatch can't replace Team Fortress 2 for us, but it’s certainly recaptured the experience of getting a bunch of friends together for night-long sessions of the current top shooter. Competitive mode is out now, and we’re keen to earn some golden guns.

The Witcher 3:Blood and Wine ▪ Our review (94%)
Release date: May 31, 2016 ▪ Developer: CD Projekt RED

Doom
Release date: May 12, 2016 ▪ Developer: id Software
Doom's reverence of a primordial aspect of FPS design—killing—borders on comical exaggeration with its fountains of demon blood and a main character who communicates by punching things. That fittingly fuels fast and fun combat indulging the nostalgia of id's run-and-gun lineage without smothering its metal brutality. Doom's first major update since launch adds a Photo mode for screenshots and ups the classic feel with an optional center-aligned weapon model.

Racing
Shift 2
Shift 2 might be the best compromise between realism and accessibility of any game on this list. It’s not just the ways the car handle — menacing, but capable — but the way it consistently thinks about what players need to perform at a high level. Rather than lock your view gazing out over the hood, or ask you to spring for TrackIR to let you turn your head, Shift 2 has a dynamic view that subtly changes based on context.

Driver: San Francisco
Every arcade racer should be as cool as this game. If Steve McQueen were digitized and turned into a videogame, he would be Driver: San Francisco. While Driver: SF features cars and influences from a variety of eras, it approaches everything with a 70’s style. It loves American muscle, roaring engines, squealing tires, and the impossibly steep hills and twisting roads of San Francisco. It may have the single greatest soundtrack of any racing game, and some of the best event variety.

Dirt Rally
Codemasters’ Dirt Rally has surpassed its predecessor, Dirt 3, and is arguably the best game Codemasters have made in years. With a far more authentic handling model, Dirt Rally does away with many of the arcadey touches that continue to persist in the core series. That also makes it a proper rally game, in a way gamers haven't seen in a long while. It's not just that these races happen to be set on dirt tracks with loads and loads of sideways slidey driving, but that you're actually taking part in the kind of endurance racing that rallying is all about. You’ll have to take care of your car through every race stage, which introduces an element of strategy and resource management that's all too rare in sim-racing.
